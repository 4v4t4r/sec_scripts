# sec_scripts

needs to be a listing of helpful or re-usable security based scripts

right now just a place to house everything from bashrc to random function scripts

need to refactor actual usable scripts later 

need to sort this more logically later - instead of by language by use scanning/enum/fuzzing/etc
